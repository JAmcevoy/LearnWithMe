# Learn with Me

Welcome to **Learn with Me**, the ultimate learning app designed to empower users by sharing and discovering knowledge. Whether you're a student, professional, or lifelong learner, this app is your go-to platform for mastering new skills and expanding your horizons.

## What is *Learn with Me*?

*Learn with Me* is more than just a learning toolâ€”it's a vibrant community where you can:

- **Share Your Wisdom:** Post your own tips, tricks, and insights to help others learn more effectively.
- **Discover New Ideas:** Browse and interact with posts from fellow users to gain fresh perspectives and innovative techniques.
- **Connect and Collaborate:** Join discussions and chat with people who share your interests, fostering a collaborative learning environment.

## Planning

- **Home/Feed**: 
  - This page will display a list of different users' posts.
  - It will serve as the main/home page. Starting here helps set a standard design for the rest of the app.
  - Consider a unique approach for the navbar: use a side component for navigation on larger screens, while maintaining a standard mobile navbar for smaller screens.

- **Profile**:
  - This page will show the current user's profile information.
  - It will include recent posts, recent likes, and counts for followers and following.
  - Aim to consolidate all necessary user information and relevant actions in one place.

- **Interest Circles**:
  - This page will act as a groups component, bringing users with similar interests together.
  - The design should be straightforward and aligned with the 'Circles' concept to ensure clarity and usability.

- **Chats**:
  - This will be a sub-page of Interest Circles, where users can read messages posted by others in the circle.
  - Keep the design simple and user-friendly, consistent with common social media chat interfaces.

## Existing Features

- **Sidebar/Navigation Bar**

  - The Sidebar displays different icons based on your authentication status:
    - **Logged In**: Home, Interest Circles, Create a Post, Profile Icon, Log Out icon.
    - **Logged Out**: Home, Sign In, Sign Up.
  - The Sidebar is collapsible; even when closed, the icons remain functional as links, so users don't need to expand the Sidebar to change pages.

  - The Chat Page features a simple message interface with a white background for readability.
